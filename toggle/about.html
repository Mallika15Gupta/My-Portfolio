	<p style="color:white"><b style="font-size: 25px;">What else I do??</b><br>
<p style="color:white"> I have always been into anything that involves creativity, art, interaction with public and involves innovation. Raised as an opinionated girl, I am thankful to my parents who allowed me to learn things and create my own ways. This has made me into a person who loves sharing her thoughts through her writings and illustrations to make people hear her in this loud, chaotic world. So yes, in my mean-time, I love reading, writing and drawing digital illustrations. I also share my small work on instagram and love connecting with people. I have also worked as a freelance writer earlier and was awarded with certificates and swags. 
 My key-strengths are communication, flexibility, quick and agile learner, leadership and team-work. <br>I'll be happy to join creative teams to work on young-eyed commercial or social projects. If you think we can create something great together, feel free to contact me!</p>
